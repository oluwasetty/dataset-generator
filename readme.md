# Dataset Generator

The task is to generate a new dataset with similar samples based on the characteristics of a given dataset

## Installation

Activate a virtual environment. Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required libraries.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the original code and the new code to generate and save the dataset files, run the command below in your terminal.

This runs default.py which generates and saves the original dataset in a csv file.

```bash
python default.py
```

This runs new_dataset.py which generates and saves the new similar dataset in a csv file.

```bash
python new_dataset.py
```
To verify the similarities between the two datasets, run the ***similarity_verification.ipynb*** file
